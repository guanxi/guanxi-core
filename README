Introduction
------------
The Guanxi system will let you do all sorts of Shibboleth and SAML2 compatible single sign on (SSO)
things. It implements the Shibboleth Profile of the SAML1.1 specification as well as various SAML2
profiles. Don't get confused with the Internet2 Shibboleth software, which is the reference
implementation of the Shibboleth SAML Profile. Guanxi is another implementation.
Born on the Isle of Skye in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Guanxi started life as a
UK JISC funded core middleware project, lead by the University of the Highlands and Islands
in partnership with the University of Oxford and Leeds University.

The Guanxi Core module contains the root pom.xml as well
as all the localised resources for the other Guanxi modules
