How to build Guanxi releases
============================

o Files in this directory
o Available release targets
o Build configurations
o Release configurations

Files in this directory
=======================
In this directory you'll find two build files:
build.xml - controls the release building process
build.properties - configuration file for build.xml

and a directory:
config - this holds all the module checkout configuration files

Available release targets
=========================
To see what can be released, use the command:

ant

This will display a list of release targets in the build file

Build configurations
====================
build.properties specifies all the paths for the build process

Release configurations
======================
Individual module release configuration files are stored in the [build.properties].release.properties.dir
Each module has it's own properties file telling the build process what to check out and what tags to use.
