ID_NO_PROVIDER_ID=Normally, your Identity Provider will display a login screen, where you can enter your username and password and have them verified by your institution. However, if you're seeing this message instead, it means you are contacting the Identity Provider directly. A login page is only displayed if you first try to access a resource, such as a web page, at another institution. You will then be redirected to the login page at your Identity Provider.
